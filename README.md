This project includes statistical analyses of three datasets, conducted as part of a university assignment. For each dataset, the goal was to test a given hypothesis by:

Identifying independent and dependent variables

Planning the analysis pipeline (including assumption checks and post-hoc tests)

Selecting and justifying appropriate statistical tests

Generating summary statistics and visualizations

Interpreting results at each step

Drawing clear conclusions based on the data

The code is structured according to a provided template, with well-documented steps and commentary to explain each analysis decision.
